# Sonjan sarjiscorner, a comics site

This site made with ReactJS and Material UI is my final project for the course 'Front End Programming' of Haaga-Helia UAS.

The site lists the comics or graphic novels I have read (I am going refer the both of them with the term 'comic'). The site provides features to show further details of one comic book, to add a new comic or edit an existing one, or to delete a comic book. The comic list can be filtered with the name of the comic.

The site has a information page, which contains a simple pie chart of how many different comics I have read either in Finnish, English or other language.

Screenshots of the project can be found on 'screenshots' folder.


## How the application works

* Start the application with the command "run dev"
* start the backend database with the command "node comicServer.js" from the /back directory
* If the database is not yet created, create the  backend database with the command "node createComic.js" from the /back directory

 To use the application, both the frontend application and backend needs to be running at the same time.
